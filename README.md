You may have noticed, as I have, that the RockBox experience is extremely broken with the famous red CompactFlash adapter on the iPod Minis. Even with the latest RockBox daily build, the operating system crashes incessantly and the experience is unusable.

So I did my own research and found that RockBox needed to be patched to support certain types of Flash memory on iPod Minis.

I found a Docker template on GitHub but unfortunately it was incomplete. I also tried to build on my Mac M1 and unfortunately the script doesn't work natively it seems. I also found an already-built build on Reddit, but it was several years old so I preferred not to use it.

After several hours of tinkering, I've built a functional, modern Dockerfile that allows me to patch and then build a working RockBox build for my iPod Mini. I haven't tried it out much yet, but the problem of crashes doesn't seem to arise any more, and I've been able to play back several FLAC songs without a hitch.

I provide my own builds if you don't know how to use Docker to help you, but be aware that these builds will probably become obsolete in a few months or years and you'll probably have a better experience if you build it yourself.

Feel free to give me some feedbacks on this and to star my GitHub project and say thank you here if it helped you someway.
